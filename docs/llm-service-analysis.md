# LLM Service Analysis

## Overview
The LLM service in the video-generator microservice provides comprehensive AI capabilities for generating various types of content including narrative scripts, video prompts, image prompts, music prompts, and image analysis.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Narrative Script Generation
- Generates emotional, concise, and memorable voice narration scripts
- Supports different durations (20s, 30s, 60s) with appropriate word limits
- Includes attention-grabbing introduction, attractive development, and memorable closing

### 2. Video Prompt Enhancement
- Converts base prompts into detailed JSON structures for video generation
- Includes scene details, characters, camera movements, lighting, visual style, and interaction focus
- Returns structured JSON ready for use in video generation pipelines

### 3. Image Prompt Enhancement
- Improves base prompts for image generation with detailed artistic direction
- Includes visual style, background details, realistic or dramatic lighting, composition, perspective, and color palettes
- Optimized for AI image generation models

### 4. Music Prompt Generation
- Creates detailed prompts for AI music generation
- Specifies genre, BPM, instrumentation, emotional state, dynamics, and relevant sound effects
- Ready for use with AI music generation services

### 5. Image Analysis and Enhancement
- Analyzes images and suggests improvements for marketing purposes
- Generates detailed descriptions of products in images
- Suggests appropriate backgrounds for marketing materials

### 6. Image Classification
- Classifies images into categories: person, product, pet, landscape, or other
- Useful for automated content categorization and routing

## Integration with Current System

The LLM service exposes the `/llm/generate-json` endpoint which is consumed by our backend's [PromptJsonService](file:///c:\MisyBot\RealCulture%20AI\backend\src\infrastructure\services\prompt-json.service.ts#L5-L60). This service is used by the [PromptJsonController](file:///c:\MisyBot\RealCulture%20AI\backend\src\interfaces\controllers\prompt-json.controller.ts#L26-L120) to provide the `/api/prompt-json` endpoint.

## Current Implementation vs. Full LLM Service

Our current implementation only uses the video prompt enhancement capability through the `/llm/generate-json` endpoint. The full LLM service provides additional capabilities that could be leveraged:

1. **Narrative Script Generation** - Could be used for audio content generation
2. **Image Prompt Enhancement** - Could improve image generation quality
3. **Music Prompt Generation** - Could enhance music generation capabilities
4. **Image Analysis** - Could be used for automated content analysis and tagging
5. **Image Classification** - Could improve content organization and search

## Potential Enhancements

1. **Expand API Endpoints**: Create additional endpoints in our backend to leverage the full capabilities of the LLM service
2. **Enhanced Content Generation**: Use narrative script generation for more sophisticated audio content
3. **Improved Image Generation**: Utilize enhanced image prompts for higher quality visual content
4. **Better Music Generation**: Implement enhanced music prompts for more varied and appropriate musical accompaniments
5. **Automated Content Analysis**: Use image analysis and classification for better content management

## Technical Details

The LLM service uses:
- Azure OpenAI GPT models for text generation
- GPT-4 Vision models for image analysis
- Environment variables for API configuration:
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_URL`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`

The service includes comprehensive error handling and logging for all operations.
