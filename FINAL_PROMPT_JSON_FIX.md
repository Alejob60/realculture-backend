# Final Prompt-JSON Endpoint Fix

## Issue Summary
The [/api/prompt-json](file:///c:/MisyBot/RealCulture%20AI/backend/src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts#L12-L12) endpoint was returning a 500 Internal Server Error with the message "Token inválido o usuario no identificado" because it couldn't properly extract the user ID from the JWT token.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **JWT Token Structure**: The JWT tokens contain user information in the payload with the user ID in the `sub` field
2. **JwtStrategy Implementation**: The JwtStrategy correctly extracts the `sub` field but returns it as the `id` field in the user object
3. **PromptJsonController Bug**: The controller was looking for `userId` or `sub` fields but not the `id` field that JwtStrategy actually provides

## Fix Implementation
Updated the [PromptJsonController](file:///c:/MisyBot/RealCulture%20AI/backend/src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts#L17-L120) to correctly extract the user ID from the `id` field:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
const userId = (req as any)?.user?.userId || (req as any)?.user?.sub;

// After (correct):
const userId = (req as any)?.user?.id;
```

## Verification
1. ✅ Created test script to verify JWT token structure and user object mapping
2. ✅ Confirmed that JwtStrategy returns user object with `id` field containing the user ID
3. ✅ Updated controller to extract user ID from the correct field
4. ✅ Application builds and starts successfully
5. ✅ Endpoint is accessible and properly handles authentication

## Files Modified
- [src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts](file:///c:/MisyBot/RealCulture%20AI/backend/src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts) - Fixed user ID extraction

## Testing Results
The test script confirmed:
- JWT tokens contain user ID in the `sub` field
- JwtStrategy correctly maps `sub` to `id` in the returned user object
- Controller now correctly extracts user ID from the `id` field

## Expected Behavior
1. Valid JWT tokens will be properly authenticated
2. User ID will be correctly extracted from the token
3. User will be looked up in the database
4. Credits will be checked and decremented appropriately
5. JSON will be generated using the prompt-json service
6. Results will be returned to the client

## Error Handling
The endpoint will now properly handle:
- Invalid or missing tokens (401 Unauthorized)
- Users not found in database (404 Not Found)
- Insufficient credits (403 Forbidden)
- Invalid prompts (400 Bad Request)
- Service errors (500 Internal Server Error)

This fix ensures consistent behavior with other authenticated endpoints in the application that rely on the same JWT strategy.
