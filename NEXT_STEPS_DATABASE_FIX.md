# Next Steps for Database Schema Fix

Based on our analysis, here's what needs to be done to fix the database schema issues that are preventing the gallery endpoint from working correctly.

## Current Issues

1. **Database Connection**: The PostgreSQL database doesn't appear to be running locally on the expected port (5544)
2. **Schema Problems**: The database has duplicate columns with different names and type mismatches
3. **Foreign Key Relationships**: Missing proper relationships between users and contents tables

## Files You Have

1. **`fix-database-schema.sql`** - Comprehensive SQL script to fix all schema issues
2. **`DATABASE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Detailed instructions on how to apply the fix
3. **`check-database-connection.js`** - Script to verify database connection
4. **`test-gallery-after-fix.js`** - Script to test the gallery endpoint after fixing

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Start Your Database

You need to start your PostgreSQL database. Depending on your setup, this could be:

**Option A: If using Docker**
```bash
# Look for docker-compose files in your project root or parent directories
# If found, run:
docker-compose up -d
```

**Option B: If using a local PostgreSQL installation**
- Start the PostgreSQL service through Windows Services
- Or run the PostgreSQL server executable

**Option C: If using a cloud database**
- Ensure your database connection settings in `data-source.ts` match your cloud database credentials

### Step 2: Verify Database Connection

Run the connection check script:
```bash
node check-database-connection.js
```

This should show successful connection and display current table structures.

### Step 3: Apply the Schema Fix

Once the database is running and accessible:

1. **Review the SQL script** in `fix-database-schema.sql` to understand what changes will be made
2. **Backup your database** before applying any changes
3. **Run the schema fix** using one of the methods in `DATABASE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Step 4: Test the Gallery Endpoint

After applying the schema fix:

1. Restart your backend application
2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node test-gallery-after-fix.js
   ```
3. Or test manually with a valid JWT token:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/gallery
   ```

## What the Fix Does

The `fix-database-schema.sql` script will:

1. **Clean up duplicate columns**:
   - Keep only `resetToken` and `resetTokenExpires` in the users table
   - Keep only `creatorUserId` in the contents table
   - Keep only `media_url` in the contents table
   - Keep only `created_at` in the contents table

2. **Fix type mismatches**:
   - Ensure all user ID columns are of type `UUID`
   - Ensure proper data type consistency

3. **Add foreign key constraints**:
   - Create proper relationship between users and contents tables

4. **Add missing indexes**:
   - Improve query performance for common operations

5. **Add any missing columns**:
   - Ensure all columns required by the Content entity exist

## Expected Outcome

After applying the fix:
- The gallery endpoint should work correctly
- SAS URLs should be generated for media files
- Only content from the current month should be returned
- The data cleanup module should work properly
- Database queries should be more efficient

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Connection problems**: Verify database credentials in `data-source.ts`
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure your database user has ALTER TABLE privileges
3. **Data conversion errors**: Some existing data might not convert properly to UUID
4. **Foreign key constraint violations**: Some contents might reference non-existent users

## Need Help?

If you need assistance with any of these steps:
1. Check the database logs for error messages
2. Verify your database connection settings
3. Ensure you have proper backup before making changes
4. Contact your database administrator if needed
