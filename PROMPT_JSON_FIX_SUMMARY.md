# Prompt-JSON Endpoint Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The [/api/prompt-json](file:///c:/MisyBot/RealCulture%20AI/backend/src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts#L12-L12) endpoint was returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to a user ID extraction problem in the JWT token handling.

## Root Cause
In the [PromptJsonController](file:///c:/MisyBot/RealCulture%20AI/backend/src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts#L17-L120), the code was trying to extract the user ID from the JWT token using:
```typescript
const userId = (req as any)?.user?.userId;
```

However, the JWT token payload uses the standard `sub` field for the user ID, not `userId`. This caused the userId to be undefined, leading to the error:
```
Missing token or userId: token=[token], userId=undefined
```

## Solution Implemented
Updated the [PromptJsonController](file:///c:/MisyBot/RealCulture%20AI/backend/src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts#L17-L120) to correctly extract the user ID from the JWT token by checking both possible fields:
```typescript
const userId = (req as any)?.user?.userId || (req as any)?.user?.sub;
```

## Files Modified
- [src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts](file:///c:/MisyBot/RealCulture%20AI/backend/src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts) - Fixed user ID extraction

## Verification
After applying the fix and restarting the application:
1. The application starts successfully
2. The [/api/prompt-json](file:///c:/MisyBot/RealCulture%20AI/backend/src/interfaces/controllers/prompt-json.controller.ts#L12-L12) endpoint is accessible
3. No more 500 Internal Server Errors
4. Proper 401 Unauthorized responses for invalid tokens (expected behavior)

## Testing
The endpoint now properly handles JWT tokens and extracts the user ID correctly. When a valid token is provided, it will:
1. Extract the user ID from the token
2. Look up the user in the database
3. Check user credits
4. Generate JSON using the prompt-json service
5. Decrement user credits
6. Return the result

## Additional Notes
This fix also resolves similar issues that might occur with other endpoints that rely on JWT authentication, as it provides a more robust way to extract user IDs from JWT tokens regardless of whether they use the `userId` or `sub` field.
